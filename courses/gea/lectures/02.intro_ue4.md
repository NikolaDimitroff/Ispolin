Warning: the following slides may severely damage your mind. Please continue with care.

## Unreal is huge!

* 40k files
* 5k directories
* Millions of code
* Hundreds of modules
* Who-knows-how-many tools
* Centuries of man-years

## Tips for starting

* Don't expect to learn everything! Even master Tim doesn't!
![Master Tim](tim_sweeny)
* UE4 is well-architectured. In time, you'll see that searching
for unknown features is pretty straightforward (unless you
are searching for core Editor features, that sucks).
* Be patient, write a lot of code

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Tips for starting

* There are many sample projects. Go test them!
* There are many video tutorials. Go watch them!
* There are many bugs we've encountered. Come ask us!

## UE4 for our purposes

* We'll always work **only** in the latest version.
Consider upgrading the engine whenever a new patch comes out
your permament homework
* We'll also use VS2015 (although, UE4's support for it is *experimental*)
* We'll *only* run UE4 from source. Binary distributions are for suckers
and suckers tend to get banished to the ethereal world.

## Setting up UE4

1. Create a github account if you don't already own one.
2. Go to [unrealengine.com](http://unrealengine.com)
and sign up.
3. Go to your profile and enter your github name.
4. Wait.

## Setting up UE4

5. Go to [the github repo](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine)

```cmd
git clone git@github.com:EpicGames/UnrealEngine.git
cd UnrealEngine
setup.bat
GenerateProjects.bat -2015
start UE4.sln
```

6. Build *->* Build Solution

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Setting up takes a lot of time - depending on your machine
and network connection it might take between 1 and 4 hours.

Be patient and read some tutorials meanwhile.

### Running the engine for the first time

* Start from VS as usual (F5 / Ctrl + F5)

### Where's all the code?

UE4 uses two main languages for programming

* C++ for all the core stuff
* Blueprints (BP) - a visual scripting language for designers and prototyping

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

According to Epic, Blueprints are 10 times slower than C++. Dont
use them for important things.

All templates have both a C++ and a BP version. Choose your starter.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Create your first project using the FPS template
* Shoot stuff!
* Choose another template
* Do stuff!

## Directory structure

The engine and your games share the same structure

* /Binaries – Executables & DLLs for the Engine
* /Build – Files needed for building the Engine
* /Config – Configuration files
* /Content – Shared Engine content
* /DerivedDataCache – Cached content data files (Engine only)
* /Intermediate – Temporary build products (Engine only)
* /Plugins – Shared and project specific plug-ins
* /Saved – Autosaves, local configs, screenshots, etc.
* /Source – Source code for all the things!
