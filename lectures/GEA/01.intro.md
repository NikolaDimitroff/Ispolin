# What's this course about?

### The secret holy order of illuminati game developers

(just kidding)

(we'll have to kill you if we tell you about it)

## Game development

* How does a game team look like?
* What do they do?
* How does a commercially-succesful game engine look like?
* Is Unreal Engine 4 *awesome*? (hint: yes, yes it is)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# Who should visit the course?

* Pokemons and power rangers.

In their absence, we'll have to fill in the gaps with:
* DEVELOPERS
* DEVELOPERS
* DEVELOPERS

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* We'll focus on the hardcore (and more interesting) side of game development - programming
* We'll explain fancy keywords
* And advanced algorithms / techniques
* We'll only spend some itty-bitty time discussing game design and content creation (they deserve a course of their own!)
* But you'll get to see how awesome UE4 is.
* We'll make it hard to you - homeworks, tests and a course project. Cheaters will be *bannished to the ethereal world.*

# Why do we do it?

* We like torturing people
* We also *kind of* like speaking to game developers
* We work at Coherent Labs and we greatly value talent
  - Come visit at the next Sofia GameDev Meetup
  - Do well in the course and come work with us

## Shameless advertisement time

* Coherent Labs makes UI middleware<sup>1</sup>
* We let people use HTML5 to build what's otherwise mundane, slow and error-prone
* We are platform-friendly<sup>2</sup> - Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, WP8, iOS, Android, PS4, Xbox One
* We are engine-friendly - deep integrations into UE4 and Unity3D

<p class="left-aligned">
    <sup>1</sup> Awesome UI middleware
    </br>
    <sup>2</sup> Except for Mac which we sincerely fucking hate. Must be bannished to the ethereal world.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Most sophisticated free engine on the market
* Best looking graphics
* *Awesome* architecture
* Huge community
* [Ton of your favourite games have been made with it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games)
  - Batman: Arkham *
  - Bioshock
  - Borderlands
  - Deus Ex
  - Gears of War
  - Mass Effect
  - Tom Clancy

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* *Bad* & *insufficient* docs
* Lack of teaching materials
* Difficult beginnings
* Being C++, compile times can become terrible

## Unity3D

![Blacksmith shaders](https://unity3d.com/profiles/unity3d/themes/unity/images/pages/the-blacksmith/full/unique_shadows.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* The best OK engine
* Good looking graphics
* Easy to start
* *Very* quick iteration
* Huge community
* [King in the mobile / indie department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unity_games)
  - Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft
  - Kerbal Space Program
  - Ori and the Blind Forest

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Not AAA material
* Crappy architecture
* Bad performance on everything but mobile
